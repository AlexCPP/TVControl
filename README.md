# TVControl
A thrust vectoring stabilization library for Arduino based amateur rocketry.

This library is part of a proof of concept design for a rocket attitude controller using a gimballing rocket engine. It is the product of an effort made by an undergraduate group of student members of Cal Poly Pomona's Undergraduate Missiles, Ballistics, and Rocketry Association.

This project is designed to be a low cost system that can be used in high power rocketry by those who would rather use an active guidance system over a more passive systems such as attaching stabilizing fins to the lower end of the rocket. The benefits of this system include integration with Arduino boards currently being used by many Cal Poly rockets, the potential elimination of stabilizing fins which create exterior drag on a rocket, and lowering the learning curve required for many of our lower division students who are interested in getting involved with rocketry.

While this system is still being developed, this Github repository will be a tool used in the development of our proof of concept rocket, which will contain a system that can gimbal a solid rocket engine in flight to maintain flight control. Eventually, this repository will also be a place to publish our design notes, schematics, and project results.
